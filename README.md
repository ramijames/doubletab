# Doubletab
Doubletab.com wordpress theme based on Eddie Machado's awesome Bones theme.

In this theme, we are using Advanced Custom Fields for the background images (bg_background) on the homepage and the single post views.

To get things set up correctly, create a category (we used "Portfolio") and assign that category id to the homepage's loop.

### License

As with the bones theme, this is released under the DoTheFuckWhatYouWant license.
