Wordpress Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme

A Wordpress theme built from scratch with Bootstrap 3. It's a starting point for any Wordpress / Bootstrap 3 development efforts, not a finished product. 

It allows for configuring a custom logo in the wp-admin area. 

I've solved the nasty navigation issues that you'll run into if starting from scratch using wp-bootstrap-navwalker from Edward McIntyre.

It has a custom frontpage, if you care to use it, based on one of the Bootstrap examples.

Let me know if you have any issues with it, and feel free to send requests!
