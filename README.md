# Doubletab
Doubletab.com wordpress theme based on Eddie Machado's awesome Bones theme.

In this theme, we are using Advanced Custom Fields for the background images (bg_background) on the homepage and the single post views.

# Setup

1. Create a category (we used "Portfolio") and assign that category id to the homepage's loop.
2. Install Advanced Custom Fields.
3. Create a new fieldset called "post_options"
4. Create a field in "post_options" called "bg_background" of fieldtype "image".
5. "Show this field group if" should be set to "is not equal to" a page which is not the homepage.

### License

As with the bones theme, this is released under the DoTheFuckWhatYouWant license.
